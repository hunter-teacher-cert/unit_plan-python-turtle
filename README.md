# Python Turtle 
by Christopher De Silva

-----

### General Overview
Students would be able to use python code to draw simple shapes using the tutle library. Students would first be introduced to using libraries and why they are important/useful. Students will be able to use computational thinking skills to look for repeating patterns and include them in your programming. Create an image using multiple shapes.Draw complex repeating patterns using nested loops and draw images using color and random values.

### Motivation for Unit
When it comes to coding students are more interested in seeing more visual assignments than making a program that stores data or to make an application that is not very visual. With this students would be able to see their code come to life and have control over what it is doing and what it looks like.
